# ApartmentHunt

### OVERVIEW

Apartment Hunt is a website that replicates the functionality of sites like Zillow or AirBnb. The site allows users to freely look through different apartments that have been uploaded to the Apartment Hunt website. Uploaded listings can be performed by logged-in agents using the agent loggin. They uniquely have an agent portal option on the navigation bar that will give them the option to go to a listing upload page or a portal that compiles all of their inquiries and documents that clients may have uploaded. Clicking on a client will open up a direct messaging chatbox that they can contact the specific client with. A client won't have the portal, but rather a message icon that will drop down their message histories and open up a chat box upon clicking. They have the ability to click on the address on the chat box and be re-routed to the specific apartment profile page. Each profile page has a lot of attributes and information that allow clients to see schools, crime, restaurants, etc. in the area and also see gallery of pictures and even virtual tours in some cases.

### GOALS

1. Allow users to search for an apartment and filter by certain parameters.
2. Allow agents to answer user questions.
3. Allow for secure document uploads.
4. Allow for agents to add listings.
5. Allow agents to upload virtual tour of apartments.
